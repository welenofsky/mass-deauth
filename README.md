### PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID WITH THIS SCRIPT!!!
##### If you have a problem with using this, please open an issue [here][1]. If you have any improvements, feel free to let me know, or fork this project. Or even better yet, create a pull request [here][2] with your patch for me to look at! I deleted the part with the MAC changer - it was giving me problems. I will add it back in the future when all the bugs are worked out. Tested on Kali Linux, Debian, Arch Linux, and WEAKERTH4N Linux.
